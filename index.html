            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

            <p>Instead of the boring ol' "Lorem Ipsum" BS, I figured I'd actually fill this out and see if anyone
                actually reads this.</p>

            <p>(Seriously, though - why is there a cat picture in my "About" Page? ... Aww, never mind.)</p>

            <p>I was born in the depths of the Himalayas, to an ancient shaman and his concubine (That's right - I'm the
                product of magic, b*tches!), and I have lived in this lovely nation for the better part of 34 years. I
                am a Cancer (the Crab, not the illness), and I enjoy YouTube in my spare time.</p>

            <p>Seriously, though - I am currently fighting for my immigration status, and I'm stressed the hell out
                about it. That's right motherf***ers - I'm not an American citizen, and that's the god's honest truth -
                and I could easily get kicked out of this country on a whim by immigration, if they wanted. Le sigh.</p>

            <p>I'm a sports nut, my favorite teams are the Sacramento Kings and the San Francisco 49ers, and I enjoy a
                little fantasy football every now and then. I used to write a sports blog and have a YouTube channel,
                but that kind of fell through after awhile. This whole coding thing is my last-ditch effort to get a
                real job and get my green card. Crossing my fingers everything works out. What was the question again?
            </p>

            <p>(P.S. - one of the facts I stated above is a bold-faced lie. You can probably figure out which one that
                is.)</p>
